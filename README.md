Location recommendation GUI combining user-based collaborative filtering, power law distribution and Multi-gaussian model

This GUI is created based on Sina weibo's user checkin data, it could be changed.

Different recommendation strategies could be used seperately,

such as user-based collaborative filtering, power law distribution and multi-gaussian model,

and also, they could be combined together linearly and non-linearly, results show explicitly.

It's created for my dissertation, if any questions and suggestions, please leave a comment or e-mail ryogaw1994@gmail.com. 

I'm available and happy to discuss:)
